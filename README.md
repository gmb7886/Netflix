# Netflix Alternative Client for Android TV Boxes #

<img src="https://github.com/gmb7886/Netflix/blob/master/app/src/main/ic_launcher-playstore.png" width="200"/> 

This is an attempt to make Netlfix work on non-certified devices (mainly TV boxes), with or without Android TV...

Implemented:
1. Virtual mouse to facilitate navigation with remote control
2. Successful login

Still missing:
1. Playing videos through Webview without Widevine certificates.

ATTENTION: All copyrights to Netflix and its partners.
